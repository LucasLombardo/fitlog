- the package.json for the frontend is located in frontend/package.json, do not attempt to install things at the root level of the project
- after every change, run `npm run test && npm run lint && npm run format` to verify tests work and fomatting/linting standards are followed
- never write inline styles unless absolutely necessary
- when creating new components: page level components should go in src/app/pages/, others in src/app/components. New components should have 4 files: .html, .scss, .spec.ts, and .ts
